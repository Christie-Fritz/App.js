# App.js
This week we learned about Formik/React. We had to create a "Sign In" app with "email", "password, and "Submit" Button required. I struggled a bit on this trying to make it look the way I wanted, but will get the hang of it! 

## Changes to come
Will have a more clean "sign in" format, Have it centered, and the "Email" and "Password" boxes will be titled
